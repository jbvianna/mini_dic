# mini_dic
This project is an example of client-server aplication used in a workshop for app development using HTML, Javascript and node.js
The server part uses just the resources available in node.js, and the HTTP server has just the functionality to serve
the static files of the client app and its GET requests.

The project has all the files for a complete application, along with a small set of sample dictionaries in the recursos folder.
The client part of the app is in the cliente folder.
